This zip files contains programs which convert normal texts into ciphered texts, vice versa.
Each program encodes texts via different methods.
Currently there are ciphers based on Caesar, Vigenere, Morse.

Input texts: Contain only 1 line, insert only your texts there, nothing else.
 *Special case:	- For Vigenere-ci, the first line is your texts, the second line is your keyword.
		- For Vigenere-de, the first line is your ciphered texts, the second line is your keyword.
Output texts:
 - Caesar: 26 lines of each encoded/decoded texts (text in each line is increased by 1 character).
 - Morse: 1 line only, contain encoded texts.
 - Vigenere: 1 line only, contain encoded texts.

Where to insert your inputs? In (cipher type)-in.txt
Where to receive your outputs? In (cipher type)-out.txt

Program type;
(cipher type)-ci.exe: Encodes your input texts.
(cipher type)-de.exe: Decodes your input ciphers.
